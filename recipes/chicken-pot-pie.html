    <!-- Short description -->
    <p>It's homey and golden like the sun</p>
    <h3>Short disclaimer:</h3>
    <p>
      My personal opinion, chicken goes well with the cream in this dish but the
      flavor gets repetitive alongside other american dishes and can be bland.
      Tweak the vibes a little bit and make it Indian or West African inspired
      (on that note, I support switching up the meat so go crazy). Any spice in
      Africa works really.

    <!-- Recipe -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One (1) homemade pie crust (they say homemade but if you don't got the
        time, get the store bought one, I'll keep it a secret homie)
      </li>
      <li>Four (4) cups cooked chicken, shredded</li>
      <li>Six (6) Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>One (1) medium yellow onion, (1 cup chopped)</li>
      <li>Two (2) medium carrots, (1 cup) thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Eight (8) oz white or brown mushrooms, (stems discarded), sliced</li>
      <li>Three (3) garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Two (2) cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>
        Two (2) tsp fine sea salt, or to taste, plus kosher salt to garnish
      </li>
      <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, plus more to garnish</li>
      <li>One (1) cup frozen peas, do not thaw</li>
      <li>1/4 cup parsley, finely chopped, plus more to garnish</li>
      <li>One (1) egg, beaten for egg wash</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a dutch oven or pot, melt 6 Tbsp butter. Add diced onions and carrots
        and saute 8 minutes over medium heat until soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sliced mushrooms and minced garlic and saute another 5 minutes until
        mushrooms are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/3 cup flour and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add chicken stock,
        and 1/2 cup heavy cream then bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute or
        until mixture is a thick gravy consistency. Add 2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp
        black pepper, or season to taste. It should be well-seasoned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shredded cooked chicken, frozen peas, and 1/4 cup parsley. Stir to
        combine then remove from heat and cool slightly while you roll out the
        crusts. Roll 1 chilled pie crust disk into a 12” diameter circle.
        Carefully transfer it into a deep 9” pie dish. Spoon the pie filling
        over the bottom crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the second disk of pie dough into a 10” diameter circle and place
        over the pie filling. Fold the excess dough behind the bottom crust then
        crimp the pie crusts together to seal. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 5
        small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the
        crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with coarse salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 425&deg;F for 30-35 minutes or until top crust is golden brown.
        If edges are browning too fast, cover with a pie shield or make a shield
        by cutting a 4” diameter circle from the center of a sheet of foil and
        placing that over the pie. Once out of the oven, rest for 15 minutes to
        cool slightly before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
